####This is a to-do demo using jQuery Mobile framework. :)
<P>Have you ever heard about 10000 Hours Law?It was fisrt proposed by MalcolmGladwell in his book 《Outliers: The Story of Success》.</P>
<p>If you want to improve your skill to a master level, you are supposed to spend no less than 10000 hours studying or working on it.Therefore I hava made up my mind to make a webapp to supervise the progress of plans.</p>
